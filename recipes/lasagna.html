    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare lasagna noodles by soaking in cold water for 2 hours or boiling according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta ingredients in a food processor bowl and blend until the mixture has reached ricotta-like texture. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet to medium-high and brown the ground beef, breaking the meat up as it cooks. While the meat cooks, season with garlic, basil, parsley, and salt. Then, stir in the marinara sauce. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375˚F.</li>
        <li>To layer the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9×13 pan. Top with a single layer of lasagna noodles. Then, gently spread 1/3 of the vegan ricotta mixture on top. Next, add a layer of meat sauce. Repeat 2 more times and top with vegan mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Bake lasagna for 40 – 45 minutes or until the sides are bubbling and the mozzarella has melted. Remove from oven and allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.</li>
